# EL2020

Hello,
 and welcome to Josh Simons's repository for the embedded linux class. This repository will be used as an example of ways to maintain a code base while working on a project. This is NOT the Embedded Linux class itself. That is hosted on Google Classroom. Please contact Josh Simons: "simonsj [at] newpaltz [dot] edu" if you are in the class, but do not have the classroom code.
